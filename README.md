Breadcrumb with 5 transitions from 1 to 5, which shows the users progress through a journey.

Uses the StateSet to allow me to transition to the next position in the animation. 

This way I can have all the different transitions of the animation in one scene and only have one motionlayout.

But when using States, I lose all the control of the animation speed.
